JAVA should be installed in the system
Eclipse should be installed and then TestNG should be installed inside eclipse.
Open eclipse and import the commandcenter folder which i have committed in vivek209 repository --> main branch --> Code section. 
I have implemented TestNG framework and reporting is done using Extent reports.
Import project using File --> import --> Existing projects into workspace --> next --> respective folder(commandcenter)
Once project(commandcenter folder) is imported, go to testng.xml file.
On the bottom of help section, play button will be present, click the play button and click TestNG suite and then OK button.
Once execution is completed, go to path CommandCenter\ExtentReports, a new HTML file will be generated, where you can see the pass and fail status of 15 API's.
